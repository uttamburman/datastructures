 * This is slightly different from 0/1 Knapsack and Unbounded Knapsack.
 * 0/1 knapsack does not talks about picking unit of a particular item
 * Unbounded knapsack is an extension of 0/1 knapsack with unlimited supply of each item.
 * This is slightly different by the fact that unit we can divide item's value and weight to get profit of each unit weight.
